# Applixir Ads Integration: 
# applixir android studio example:
This is an Example on how to add Applixir android Ads in your android app
The project contains java and kotin Examples on how to implement Rewarded Video Ads on native Android Apps - AppLixir:

# Technical content writing about How to Integrate AppLixir Ads to your Android App:
-I helped Writing AppLixir Android Documentations about, How do you use AppLixir sdk to add Video Ads in to your android App or Game.

-Started by testing the previous documentation and edit the code Examples for implementing ads to any Android App, and How to make it less steps, clearer and faster to any android Developer to add ads.

-The Most Important steps I did inn this code enhancements were:
1-show the ads faster by creating a specific class for the webview ( contain ad site) and preparing it, before call it to show ads to the user , with that the ads will be shown faster than the normal webview.
Also by adding the call back interface to this class and that's a step I did to help me to create a connection between the webview and any activity we will use to show ads.

2-create a way of communication between the each android activity and the webview (that AppLixir use to show ads in the app) and how to get user impression for the ad (watch or close the ad in this example) and then move the user to the next activity depend on that impression.

-After Enhancing the previous Sdk Code, which was written in Java only, I also added the same Code Examples in Kotlin, so any Kotlin Android Developer can also add AppLixir Ads to his App or Game.

-The Last Step, was adding explanations to every step to make it clear for any android Dev to Get Started with AppLixir  Video Ads .
